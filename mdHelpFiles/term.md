# Term Info Help

The Term Info presents metadata relevant to the any item the user has interacted with last. For example it can be a selected individual or any class htat has been navigated to by clicking on links.

The Term Info presents ontology metadata with clickable links. Links are of different kinds, clicking on links under the query section for example will open the query interface, while clicking on external reference links will open a new browser tab for the external reference selected. Clicking on a VFB link will instead refresh the content of the Term nfo widget to the selected VFB term.

History of visited terms is retained and can be accessed by clicking on the <i class="fa fa-history" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon on the top left that will present a menu with previously visualised content as options. history can also be browsed with the arrow icons also on the top left that will behave like browser icons (when they start working properly).

If the selected term is an individual, a button bar will show up at the bottom of the Term Info widget that lets the user perform actions on the individual, such as selecting it in the 3D scene <i class="fa fa-hand-stop-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>, zooming on it in the 3D canvas <i class="fa fa-search-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i>, changing its color <i class="fa fa-tint" aria-hidden="true"></i> and finally hiding and showing it <i class="fa fa-eye" aria-hidden="true"></i>.
